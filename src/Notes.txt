    Cucumber
        Cucumber is a Framework
        We will learn the tool, and the framework

    Framework provides:
        - Organized Structure
        - Hierarchy
        - Separate place for separate codes
        - Single execution point

    We use maven as a build management tool

    gorup id - company name
    artifact id - project name

    main folder - for development code
    test folder - for testing code
        -- java - for coding part
        -- resources for non-coding part

    pom.xml -- to add dependency
    it is a configuratyion file which is considered as a backbone of the maven project

    Cucumber -- It supports behavioral driven development appraoch wherein we write our test cases specification in
                gherkin langauge (plain english)

    Keywords: features, background, scenario

                Given - precondition - Given user is navigated to the HRMS application
                When - Actions -- When the user enters username and password
                And -- this tag can come with every other keyword -- And user click on login button
                Then -- expected output - result - Then user should be able to see dashboard page


    Recap:
        Maven - build management tool

        test - here we write code for testing
            -- java - coding stuff
            -- resources - non-coding stuff

                        Given - precondition - Given user is navigated to the HRMS application
                        When - Actions -- When the user enters username and password
                        And -- this tag can come with every other keyword -- And user click on login button
                        Then -- expected output - result - Then user should be able to see dashboard page
                        Feature -- .feature -- to write scenario we use feature file


    Acceptance Criteria:
        1 search by id
        2 search by name
1. Given user opens browser and navigates to HRMS
And user is logged in as admin
And user is on employee list page
When user enters valid employee id
And user clicks on search button
Then user sees employee in the employee table
